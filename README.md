# AI Research for Collaborative Game Characters
Study materials for a research survey paper in collaboration in AI characters for games.
Abstract and works cited: [here](./Brief-Abstract-ref.pdf)

## Description
As part of my masters' studies and research, I created a survey paper focusing on the subject of building better collaborative AI characters in games. Collaborative AI is defined as one or more non-player characters (agents) crafted to interact and work with the Player and/or other agents.

The survey covered five challenging tasks for AI design and implementation:

**Movement**: Strategies for having AI characters move in collaboration with steering behaviours and pathfinding techniques.

**Knowledge Communication**: Strategies for having AI-controlled characters share and communicate local knowledge about themselves and the environment.

**Decision-Making**: Strategies for collaborative decision-making between characters in pursuit of common goals including tactical and strategic behaviour.

**Learning**: Strategies for having AI characters learn together to solve tasks more efficiently.

**Player Interaction**: Strategies for facilitating better communication between AI characters and the Player.
